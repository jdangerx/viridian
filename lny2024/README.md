# Viridian Lunar New Year 2024

## Path tracing

Similar to the first animations we did - tracing out a path from multiple
initial points, with shadows etc. Would want to do some window patterns +
various logos.

### TODO

* [ ] extract path data from SVG
* [ ] normalize path data + render as a static stroke
* [ ] interpolate along path over time
* [ ] split path into sections

## Wavy Ravy Dragon

Can we make a wiggly dragon that has the illusion of movement? What sort of
backgrounds should we make?

## Waterblob, but dragons

This is the scary rabbit gallery from before, but with more intense coloration + dragon model instead of rabbit model.

## Baroque Characters
