# Viridian Lunar New Year 2024

## Path tracing

Similar to the first animations we did - tracing out a path from multiple
initial points, with shadows etc. Would want to do some window patterns +
various logos.

### TODO
* [ ] extract path data from SVG
  * the logo files appear to be not really vectors so much as vector files with embedded bitmaps, which is frustrating. but with some inkscape fiddling we can extract an SVG path.
* [ ] render SVG path as processing strokes...
* [ ] normalize path data + render as a static stroke
* [ ] interpolate along path over time
* [ ] split path into sections

## Wavy Ravy Dragon

Can we make a wiggly dragon that has the illusion of movement? What sort of
backgrounds should we make?

## Waterblob, but dragons

This is the scary rabbit gallery from before, but with more intense coloration + dragon model instead of rabbit model.

## Baroque Characters
